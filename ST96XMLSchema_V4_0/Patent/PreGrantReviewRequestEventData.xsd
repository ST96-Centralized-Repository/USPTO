			<xsd:documentation>This is supplementary data of the ST.27 Category E (Pre-grant review request). This category is a group of events related to the request for a pre-grant review for any application covered by Category A. It includes, for example, a request for a pre-grant opposition, pre-grant re-examination, or pre-grant limitation. It also includes when such a request was inadmissible, rejected or withdrawn. The events in this category may move an application from the examination stage or the termination likely/termination stage into the pre-grant challenge stage.

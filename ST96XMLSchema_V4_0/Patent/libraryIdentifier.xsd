			<xsd:documentation>The library-identifier attribute is intended as an identifying code for the library containing priority documents - to be used where offices support the access of the documents from many such libraries. The recommended format of library-identifier should be composed of a WIPO Standard ST.3 code of the operating Office of service or digital library, together with service (or digital library) name (optional) separated by a hyphen to allow for the fact that some Office may operate more than one library. For example, "IB-DAS" for Digital Access Service for Priority Documents run by WIPO.</xsd:documentation>

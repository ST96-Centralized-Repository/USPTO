			<xsd:documentation>This is supplementary data of the ST.27 Category V (Appeal). This category is a group of events related to an appeal of a decision made during the prosecution of an IP right. It includes, for example, a request by the applicant, IP right owner, or third party for an administrative or court appeal of any decision made during the prosecution of an IP right and the procedural outcome of such an appeal. The substantive outcome of the appeal may be mapped to an event in another category, for example, application discontinued, application revived, IP right granted, IP right ceased, or IP right maintained. The appeal may relate to any type of application in Category A or any type of IP right in Category F. The events in this category may occur during any stage.</xsd:documentation>
